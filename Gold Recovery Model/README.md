# Gold Recovery Model

## Business Goal
Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra to predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.

## Skills
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, sklearn, machine learning regression

## Result
LinearRegression was the best model at predicting levels of ouput from the purification process. It was the most accurate at predicting gold recovery levels, with a final symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) score of 8.6%.
