# Gold Recovery Model

## Business Goal
Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra to predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.

## Skills
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, sklearn, machine learning regression

## Result
Based on the bootstrapping method, region 1 represented the lowest risk (0.2%) and the highest potential revenue (5.18 million USD), within a 95% confidence interval. We, therefore, suggest region 1 as the ideal region for oil development.
