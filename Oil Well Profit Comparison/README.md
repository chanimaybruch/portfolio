# Oil Well Profit Comparison

## Business Goal
An oil mining company seeks the best region for a new well. Using data from wells in three regions, analyze profitability, predict volume of reserves for new wells in these regions, and select the region with the highest total profit. Analyze potential profit and risks within a 95% confidence interval using the bootstrapping resampling technique with 1000 samples to determine the region with the highest probable profit.

## Skills
pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, machine learning regression

## Result
Based on the bootstrapping method, region 1 represented the lowest risk (0.2%) and the highest potential revenue (5.18 million USD), within a 95% confidence interval. We, therefore, suggest region 1 as the ideal region for oil development.
