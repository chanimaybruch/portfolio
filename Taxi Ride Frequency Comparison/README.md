# Taxi Ride Frequency Comparison

## Business Goal
Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago, seeks to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. We will explore the data from competitors and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.

## Skills
data preprocessing, statistical data analysis, exploratory data analysis, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy

## Result
We found a statistically significant difference in the frequency of taxi rides on rainy days.
