# Machine Learning Text Analysis

## Business Goal
The Film Junky Union, a community for classic movie enthusiasts, wanted to develop a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews. The goal was to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. Using a dataset of IMBD movie reviews we used polarity labeling to build a model for classifying positive and negative reviews, aiming for an F1 accuracy score of 0.85 or more.

## Skills
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, sklearn, machine learning, NLP

## Result
Lemmatized the reviews using NLTK, extracted features using TF-IDF, and trained a logistic regression. The F1 score for the test set was 0.88.
