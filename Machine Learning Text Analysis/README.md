# Machine Learning Text Analysis

## Business Goal
The Film Junky Union, a new edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts, is developing a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews. Our goal is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. We'll be using a dataset of IMBD movie reviews with polarity labelling to build a model for classifying positive and negative reviews. We aim to have an F1 accuracy score of 0.85 or more.

## Skills
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, sklearn, machine learning, NLP

## Result
Lemmatized the reviews using NLTK, extracted features using TF-IDF, and trained a logistic regression. The F1 score for the test set was 0.88.
