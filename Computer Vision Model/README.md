# Computer Vision Model

## Business Goal
The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore whether Data Science can help them adhere to alcohol laws by making sure they do not sell alcohol to people underage. You are asked to conduct that evaluation, so as you set to work, keep the following in mind:
The shops are equipped with cameras in the checkout area which are triggered when a person is buying alcohol
Computer vision methods can be used to determine age of a person from a photo.
The task is to build and evaluate a model for verifying people's age.

## Skills
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, sklearn, pillow, tensorflow, 

## Result
The model was able to effectively predict the ages of individuals based on their photos. The MAE of the model after epoch 14 was 6.0192. Afterwards, the model seemed to overfit. These results demonstrate the usefulness of the ResNet50 in a regression task involving a large photo dataset.
